# HER: an information theoretic alternative for geostatistics
In HER method, we propose a stochastic, geostatistical estimator which combines information theory with probability aggregation methods for minimizing predictive uncertainty, and predicting distributions directly based on empirical probability. Histogram via entropy reduction (HER) relaxes parametrizations, avoiding the risk of adding information not present in data (or losing available information). It provides a framework for uncertainty estimation that takes into account both spatial configuration and data values, while allowing to infer (or introduce) continuous or discontinuous characteristics of the field. 
We investigate the framework utility using synthetically generated datasets from Gaussian Processes with different sample sizes and data properties (different spatial correlation distances and addition of noise). 
HER method brings a new perspective of spatial interpolation and uncertainty analysis to geostatistics and statistical learning, using the lens of information theory.

The code and datasets are complementary parts of the study proposed by Thiesen, Vieira, Mälicke, Loritz, Wellmann and Ehret (2020):
